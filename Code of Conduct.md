We do not tolerate harassment of staff and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any of our events, this includes the following.

- - hacks
- - talks, presentations, or demos
- - workshops
- - any parties associated to the hackathon
- - social media
- - any other online media

Participants violating these rules **may be sanctioned or expelled** from the event **without a refund** (if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers.

We operate a very simple escalation process to deal with any incident contravening the code.

- Delegates attending the event that experience or witness any unacceptable behaviour shoud, at a first, vocalise said behaviour directly to the alleged offender to ask for it to stop
- As an alternative, or if approaching the alleged offender was unsuccessful, the individual may contact a member of the organising team - they are wearing a special badge - who will assist them.

We take any bullying or discrimination complaint seriously and look into it as soon as possible.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views. It also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.

Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
