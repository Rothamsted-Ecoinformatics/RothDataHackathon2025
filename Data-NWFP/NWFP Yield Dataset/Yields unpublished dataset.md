# Yield dataset notes

This dataset is not finalised sufficiently to be published, but is made available to hackathon participants in its nearly complete status.

## Abstract:

This dataset presents the harvest yield of silage and arable crops on the North Wyke Farm Platform.

## Methods:

Note that the ‘Experiment_ID’ column is not unique. These appear in the format NWxxx-yy, where xxx is a 3 digit code specific to the harvest year. In the silage data, yy is either S1 or S2, to indicate whether the harvest was first or second cut silage. In the arable data, yy is either WW (winter wheat), WO (winter oats) or SO (spring oats). 

The area given in the data is specifically harvest area, and not field size. Therefore, a field that was initially silage but later used for arable crops may show slightly different harvest areas. The field named ‘Burrows’ increased in harvest area between 2012 and 2014 due to reconfiguration of its boundaries. Users should also be aware that two fields, previously known as ‘Little Pecketsford’ and ‘Pecketsford’, were combined in 2019, and from this date the yields are shown under the field name ‘Pecketsford (whole)’.

Silage data contains some field splits. These occur when the grazing livestock require less grass than the farmlet is producing, and part of a field that was expected to be grazed is instead used for silage production. These fields are indicated using the temporary field name in the ‘Field split’ column, and the harvest area is given only for the silage area of the field. 

The silage harvest and yield measurements differ over time. It is important to note that the dry matter percentage is not comparable between harvest methods. The value from the Haldrup is for fresh cut grass, whereas the value from the weighbridge is for grass following a wilt.
